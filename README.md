In this paper, various possibilities of BLE were considered:
a button and LED were connected, tied to their characteristics; 
internal temperature transmission has been implemented; 
distance sensors(RCWL-0801) and light sensor(BH1750) are connected.

The application for this device was developed by https://github.com/ELIX1337
